# Memery

## Background

Memery is a classic memory card game in which all the cards are placed face down. The game is played out on a rectangular grid. The values of the cards will be internet memes. The player wins the game when all pairs of cards have been found. Until then, the locations of non-matching pairs of cards will be revealed face-up and then turned face-down. The number of moves will be kept track of.

## Functionality & MVP

Users will be able to:
- [ ] Start or reset the game

In addition, this project will include:
- [ ] A production README

## Wireframes

This app will consist of a single screen with game board, game controls, and navigation links to the Github and my LinkedIn. Game controls will include Start and Reset buttons.
